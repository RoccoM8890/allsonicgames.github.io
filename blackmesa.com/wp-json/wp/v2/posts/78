In the last couple of days we've received a ton of messages of support and curiosity about Black Mesa. It's heartening to see that the internet can still be a place where people send inquisitive messages while staying respectful - thank you. Thank you as well to those who sent the thousands of fake inquiries on our website, they made us laugh. We loved seeing the creative messages.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As many of you correctly assessed, we're actually a real company in the Boston area. We're working hard to assure and secure vaccine and other biological manufacturing production. As much as we would be honored to be part of any Valve game - we do not work in this sector at all. We are not secretly working on Half Life 3, Project White Sands (whatever that is\/may be) or any other Valve title - we're just nerds working to secure the global bioeconomy.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We &lt;3 all of you, you've made us laugh quite a bit this week at a time when we needed it.<br>We might put up a couple fun challenges and send the first solvers some swag. That is Black Mesa - the Boston biotech company swag.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Our love,<br>The Black Mesa team.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>PS: Gabe, call us.
